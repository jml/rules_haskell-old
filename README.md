# Haskell rules for [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jml/rules_haskell.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jml/rules_haskell)

Currently in development. Not ready to be used for any serious work. See [examples](examples/) for how to use, and to see present limitations.

Using [rules_go](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go) and [rules_rust](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_rust) for inspiration.

## Goals

- Useful for 80-90% of normal Haskell development
- High enough quality to be included in bazelbuild organization
